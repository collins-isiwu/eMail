# cs50w-Mail
A front-end for an email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails. This project shows my JavaScript prowress.
This is a single-page web application that's controlled by JavaScript. JavaScript makes API calls to the database (backend)  via AJAX. It stimulates an email server. Built with Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, AJAX and Bootstrap. 
JavaScript makes a GET call to request for emails in each mailbox. It makes a POST call to the backend using AJAX to save new emails. It also makes a PUT call in order to update the database on some properties of the model like the "read" property and "archive/unarchive" property of the Email model.
